### Pomodoro Timer

This project implements a Pomodoro Timer application using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This timer helps users manage their work sessions efficiently by providing visual cues for work and break intervals.

#### Description
The Pomodoro Timer application follows the Pomodoro Technique, consisting of work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks. It features a simple user interface where users can start and reset the timer, visualize the timer countdown, and track completed work sessions with checkmarks. The timer transitions between work and break intervals automatically, helping users maintain focus and productivity during work sessions.

#### Tools Used
- Python
- Tkinter
- math module

#### Results and Achievements
1. **Pomodoro Timer Functionality**: Successfully implemented the Pomodoro Technique with work intervals of 25 minutes, short breaks of 5 minutes, and long breaks of 20 minutes.
2. **User Interface Design**: Designed an intuitive user interface with visual cues for work and break intervals, enhancing user experience and productivity.
3. **Timer Reset Functionality**: Implemented a reset button to reset the timer and checkmarks, allowing users to start a new work session or reset the timer as needed.
4. **Checkmark Tracking**: Incorporated checkmarks to track completed work sessions, providing users with a visual indication of their progress.
5. **Error Handling**: Handled edge cases and error scenarios to ensure smooth functionality and prevent application crashes.

This project served as a practical exercise to reinforce Python programming skills, particularly in GUI development, event handling, and time management, while also providing insights into application design and user experience.
